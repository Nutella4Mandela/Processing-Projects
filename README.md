# Processing-Projects
This project is all about my processing projects. I wanted to diversify a bit of my knowledge into coding and it seemed simple and artistically 
friendly, so I took a crack at it to play around with it. They're very small and nothing too crazy, but it was a lot of fun to do and I've learned a 
great amount. I love this simple yet fun software and I wouldn't mind doing more cool things with it in the future.

# Grid
This one's probably the most simplest code I've ever made, but I wanted to get the full picture of how to do things properly. I just mostly used 
line code in order to get things done. It's nothing fancy, but a clean "Hello World" like code.
