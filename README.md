# Processing-Projects
This project is all about my processing projects. I wanted to diversify a bit of my knowledge into coding and it seemed simple and artistically 
friendly, so I took a crack at it to play around with it. They're very small and nothing too crazy, but it was a lot of fun to do and I've learned a 
great amount. I love this simple yet fun software and I wouldn't mind doing more cool things with it in the future.

# Grid
This one's probably the most simplest code I've ever made, but I wanted to get the full picture of how to do things properly. I just mostly used 
line code in order to get things done. It's nothing fancy, but a clean "Hello World" like code.

# Square
This one's another simple code getting into shapes and how layers work in between them. I've also used different black and white colors to
make it seem like it had a shadowy look to it.

# Quad
This code is a little bit similar to the Square code that I did, but I'm using quads to get my squares. It was a little confusing at first, but I 
managed to get thing the way I wanted it to be plus made some adjustment with the black and white colors.

# Circle
I tried testing on different colors and how to move them in fixed areas. I used a little bit of simple math to move them correctly. With a lot of
trials and errors, I got them right where I wanted them.

# Colors
This was probably one of the most coolest codes I've done! Every time you hover your mouse on different positions of the screen, the color of 
the screen changes. It's automatically black at first, but hovering it makes it slowly change color. The upper left of the screen changes to the 
original black, going back to the original color. The upper right goes and turns completely red, however. The lower left changes to blue and the 
the lower right changes to the combination of red and blue. I was really excited to see this when I was playing around with it at first. Really
cool stuff!

# Black Square
This one's relatively similar to the Color code, but I used for the purpose of emulating a mouse hovering on options. Of course, they're just black
squares, but in future projects, it'll have more life to them. Maybe making icons bigger when hovering on them, who knows?

# While Loop Circle
I made a while loop for this one to make the circle as many times as it needs to, but when it does, it gets smaller and brighter. Nothing much, 
but pretty cool effect

# Randomized Colored Squares 
Another neat code that makes a cool effect. I used a for loop to make squares spawn repeatedly in randomized positions and colors.

# Circle Color
In this code, I went a little creative on this one. I made two circle that gets affected by hovering your mouse up and down. They move into opposite directions, changing shape as they do. I also made it so that they change color as they move. It's a pretty cool effect that it makes!

# Jitterbug
I used two files for this one to make this work. I made two circles that jitter in random positions to emulate a bug moving around in nonsensical places. To do this I made a class called Jitterbug that helps it move.

# Gravity
In this one, I emulated gravity to make a square fall and bounce to the ground. I made collisions on the edges so it wouldn't fall through the ground. Another simple code!

# Pong Test
In this one, I emulated a ping pong game! I made a score counter everytime you bounce the ball with your paddle. If you miss it, it'll just go back to the screen.

# Pumpkin
I made a pumpkin out of vertices with colors. I wanted to test out and see if I can make something without textures or sprites. Just a plain old pumpkin and it looks good too!

# Solar System
This one was another fun project I made. I thought of an idea of making different planets orbiting around each other going around, so I made this. I use translate o make the orbit seem seamless, making it seem like it was going around the planets. I've also added moons to see if I could've made it go around smaller planets in a closed space.

# 3D Space
When I've heard I could've made 3d objects in processing, I knew I needed to go for it. It was surprisingly simple to learn about it. All I needed to make was 2 spheres and a box using one line of code. Then, I used ambient lighting to make it visible.

# Camera
Thsi one was to test out a bit of the camera in processing. I used a box as a tesing ground to see if anything can be moved around in the camera. A fun little gimmick, but has a lot of potential.
