# Processing-Projects
This project is all about my processing projects. I wanted to diversify a bit of my knowledge into coding and it seemed simple and artistically 
friendly, so I took a crack at it to play around with it. They're very small and nothing too crazy, but it was a lot of fun to do and I've learned a 
great amount. I love this simple yet fun software and I wouldn't mind doing more cool things with it in the future.

# Grid
This one's probably the most simplest code I've ever made, but I wanted to get the full picture of how to do things properly. I just mostly used 
line code in order to get things done. It's nothing fancy, but a clean "Hello World" like code.

# Square
This one's another simple code getting into shapes and how layers work in between them. I've also used different black and white colors to
make it seem like it had a shadowy look to it.

# Quad
This code is a little bit similar to the Square code that I did, but I'm using quads to get my squares. It was a little confusing at first, but I 
managed to get thing the way I wanted it to be plus made some adjustment with the black and white colors.

# Circle
I tried testing on different colors and how to move them in fixed areas. I used a little bit of simple math to move them correctly. With a lot of
trials and errors, I got them right where I wanted them.

# Colors
This was probably one of the most coolest codes I've done! Every time you hover your mouse on different positions of the screen, the color of 
the screen changes. It's automatically black at first, but hovering it makes it slowly change color. The upper left of the screen changes to the 
original black, going back to the original color. The upper right goes and turns completely red, however. The lower left changes to blue and the 
the lower right changes to the combination of red and blue. I was really excited to see this when I was playing around with it at first. Really
cool stuff!
