# Processing-Projects
This project is all about my processing projects. I wanted to diversify a bit of my knowledge into coding and it seemed simple and artistically 
friendly, so I took a crack at it to play around with it. They're very small and nothing too crazy, but it was a lot of fun to do and I've learned a 
great amount. I love this simple yet fun software and I wouldn't mind doing more cool things with it in the future.
